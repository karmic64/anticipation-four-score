# anticipation-four-score

Hack of Anticipation (NES) that supports the Four Score 4-player adapter, making it no longer necessary for 4 people to share 2 controllers. It doesn't support the Hori 4-player adapter because the signature is different, but I don't care much since this game is very unlikely to be played by Famicom owners anyway.

Requires [64tass](https://tass64.sourceforge.net/) and the original ROM, named `Anticipation (U) [!].nes`. This hack's romhacking.net page is [here](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8029/).
